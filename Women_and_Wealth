A large number of families in the DVC are headed by single women

 

19.3% of families in the DVC are headed by single women, compared to 10.9% of families in Massachusetts (United States Census Bureau, 2013)

 

The DVC is predominantly minority.

56% African-American and 24% Latino/Hispanic (United States Census Bureau, 2013)

 

A large number of DVC families learn low incomes and experience financial fragility.

 

43% of DVC families earn less than $25,000 a year (United States Census Bureau, 2013)

 

77% of DVC families typically have a difficult time paying their bills and 62% do not have enough savings to cover their expenses for 3 months. (Manning & Smith, 2014)

 

Women tend to accumulate less wealth than men with the same earnings. The problem is particularly acute for women of color.

 

Women of all races experience a gender wealth gap that is greater than the gender income gap, but the disparities are greatest for women of color.

 

The median wealth for single, Black women is $100 compared to $799 for single Black men and $13,800 for single White men (Insight Center for Community Economic Development, 2010)

 

The median wealth of black, single parents is $0  (Chang, 2015)

 

This is partially because of reduced access to some policies that create a "wealth escalator"

The "wealth escalator (Chang) is the set of mechanisms such as employment benefits, government benefits and tax breaks that allow some people to turn their income into wealth more quickly. Women are more likely to work part time and in jobs that do not provide these types of benefits. In addition, lower income women are disproportionately affected by parenting expenses -- especially childcare -- that leave them with little discretionary income (Chang, M. Women and wealth: Insights for grantmakers. (Chang, 2015)

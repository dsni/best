**1. What Issue do you plan to address?**
======================================
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	National need for STEM educated workers
To retain the U.S. historical preeminence in S&E, the United States will need to increase the proportion of students who receive undergraduate degrees in STEM (or the natural sciences and engineering) fields by about 34% annually over current rates. Persistent historic patterns suggest that generating such an increase will be challenging (President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	Increasing jobs for STEM workers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	Low unemployment among STEM educated workers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)	American students are not excelling in STEM
Despite improvement, nationally, few students are reaching proficiency in mathematics and science on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress. (National Science Board, 2014)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)	Blacks and Latinos are underrepresented in STEM careers
Blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in Science and Engineering careers (National Science Board, 2014)
Share of workers in S&E occupations, by selected race and ethnicity: Selected years, 1993–2010
(Percent)			


|Year|	Asian|	Black or African American|	Hispanic|
|----|:-------:|:--------------------------:|---------:|
|1993|	9.1|	3.6|	2.9|
|1995|	9.6|	3.4|	2.8|
|1997|	10.4|	3.4|	3.1|
|1999|	11.0|	3.4|	3.4|
|2003|	14.2|	4.3|	4.4|
|2006|	16.1|	3.9|	4.6|
|2008|	16.9|	3.9|	4.9|
|2010|	18.5|	4.6|	5.2|


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f)	Urban schools do not offer adequate/appropriate STEM education
“A student’s ability to enter and complete a STEM postsecondary degree or credential is often jeopardized because the pupil did not take sufficiently challenging courses in high school or spend enough time practicing STEM skills in hands-on activities" (Thomasian, 2011)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g)	There is need for ELL in schools
ELLS increased by approximately 70% between 1992 and 2002, now comprising 10.5% of the nation’s K-5 enrollment (National Council of Teachers of English, 2008)
47% of DVC families speak a language other than English at home (Manning & Smith, 2014)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h)	ELL students need additional support
ELL students generally receive lower grades and have higher drop-out rates than other students (Edvantia, 2007)

**2.	Describe the characteristics of the population and discuss the specific needs, barriers and assets of this group.** 
=======================================================================================================================
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	Black and Latino students are especially far behind
Black, Hispanic, and American Indian or Alaska Native students performed substantially lower than their white and Asian or Pacific Islander counterparts (National Science Board, 2014)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	Black and Latino students are less likely to plan to major in science and engineering than are Asian-American students. 
In 2012, more than half of Asian American or Asian freshmen reported that they intended to major in science and engineering subjects. Proportions were lower for Hispanic or Latino freshmen (42%) and lower still for white (37%), and black (36%) freshmen (National Science Board, 2014)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	Low-income students and ELL students are especially far behind
At grades K, 4, and 8, students from low-income families or homes where the primary language used was not English had lower mathematics and science scores than their peers from more advantaged backgrounds freshmen (National Science Board, 2014)

**3.	How are we going to help?**
=============================
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	Robotics helps students learn math and physics
Robotics curriculum in an after-school program is effective in increasing science, math and engineering learning in 9 to 11-year olds(Barker & Ansorge, 2007)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	Connecting math and physics to real-world technology and career options increases engagement
 "Failure to motivate student interest in math and science. In most K–12 systems, math and science subjects are disconnected from other subject matters and the real world, and students often fail to see the connections between what they are studying and STEM career options." (Thomasian, 2011)
Helping students see the connections between math and science and future career opportunities is a critical aim of the STEM pipeline (Thomasian, 2011

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	Robotics helps students learn English and Physics
Robotics curriculum promotes inquiry, makes physics more interesting and helps students learn and practice new words in English (Robinson, 2005)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)	Learning through doing helps students develop identity as scientists
Students who learn through open-ended and hands-on activities identify with math and are more able to apply math in a variety of situations (Boaler, 2002).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)	Middle school is a good time to engage students with STEM because
Student for their career plans in secondary school and it’s important for them to understand their STEM options before they do so (Thomasian, 2011)
